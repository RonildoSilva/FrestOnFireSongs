18560	2970	text	One hundred million souls are joined together
21930	2500	text	All hope for something better
24630	2050	text	And daring to just ask the question
26880	1850	text	"What is all this worth?"
28830	2460	text	Cause the answers have all lost their meaning
31490	2400	text	They got us all believing
34090	2160	text	We really have a future?
36450	1700	text	And who will get there first?
38250	2200	text	Knocked down, stumble then you fall
40650	2200	text	Stay down, find some use for it all
43050	2610	text	No way, walk before you crawl
45860	3250	text	When will you fall?
58430	2650	text	So many hopeless lives have been forgotten
61480	2450	text	Defeated once too often
64130	2110	text	Just hoping to find resolution
66440	2350	text	Held down by a greater force
68990	2300	text	In the search we find no solutions
71490	2060	text	And dream of revolutions
73750	2450	text	Wake to find we're part of the problem
76400	1750	text	So tell me what is worse?
78250	2100	text	Knocked down, stumble then you fall
80550	2160	text	Stay down, find some use for it all
82910	2740	text	No way, walk before you crawl
86050	2950	text	When will you fall?
91020	2710	text	When will you fall?
95680	2250	text	When will you fall? 
115410	2340	text	Knocked down, stumble then you fall
117950	1860	text	Stay down, find some use for it all
120010	3000	text	No way, walk before you crawl
125050	2250	text	Knocked down, stumble then you fall
127500	2050	text	Stay down, find some use for it all
129750	2880	text	No way, walk before you crawl
134690	2200	text	Knocked down
137090	2150	text	Stay down
139440	2050	text	Knocked down
141690	1210	text	Stay down
143000	1520	text	When will you fall?
147380	1880	text	When will you fall?
151840	1860	text	When will you fall?
156540	1850	text	When will you fall?
