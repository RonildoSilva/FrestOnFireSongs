34500	3100	text	It's been a long way, but now we are near
38000	2690	text	The midst of the fiery rain
42460	3050	text	We know the thunder have summoned us all
45910	3450	text	To the place where innocence got slain
50520	2980	text	Behold the omens, the river runs red
53900	2960	text	The autumn winds carry the dead
58660	3160	text	The final warning, the very last command
62220	2740	text	Shattered remains for the damned
66280	3500	text	We won't surrender
70180	3120	text	No never, we will carry on
74230	3530	text	From the lake of fire they have come
78440	3470	text	Fierce almighty legions, one by one
82640	2990	text	When the flames of glory touch the sky
86550	2500	text	Trailblazers do or die
90480	3260	text	We are the mighty, who soar through the air
94140	3070	text	Creating our own destiny
98350	3250	text	Warriors once and warriors to be
102000	3560	text	Forever our spirits fly free
106360	3350	text	We rode on lightning, we shone like the sun
110110	3270	text	In a thunderous symphony
114470	1280	text	We fought them hard
115850	2100	text	We fought them so brave
118150	2940	text	Sending them back to their grave
121980	3350	text	The hammer has fallen
126130	3090	text	The fire still burns in our hearts
130240	3590	text	From the lake of fire they have come
134690	3160	text	Fierce almighty legions, one by one
138400	3350	text	When the flames of glory touch the sky
142150	0	text	Trailblazers do or die
146850	3030	text	From the lake of fire they have come
150610	3320	text	Fierce almighty legions, one by one
154560	3340	text	When the flames of glory touch the sky
158410	2660	text	Trailblazers do or die
194730	3410	text	The visions we gazed upon
199040	2470	text	As the nightmare returned
201940	2050	text	On the uncaring slopes
204190	5060	text	The mark of the shadows still burn, burn
226620	3440	text	From the lake of fire they have come
230580	3400	text	Fierce almighty legions, one by one
234580	3200	text	When the flames of glory touch the sky
238580	2510	text	Trailblazers do or die
242580	3520	text	From the lake of fire they have come
246530	3310	text	Fierce almighty legions, one by one
250640	20	text	When the flames of glory touch the sky
254590	2260	text	Trailblazers do or die
